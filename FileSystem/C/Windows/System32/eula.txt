Hentos Operating System - End User License Agreement (EULA)

1. PROVISION OF SERVICES
By clicking "I Agree," you hereby forfeit all rights to complain about the lack of real features in this simulated environment. The "User" (that's you) understands that HentOS is a digital construct and any resemblance to a functional operating system is purely coincidental.

2. DATA PRIVACY
We value your privacy so much that we don't even have a database to store it in. Your secrets are safe because we literally cannot remember them once the game closes.

3. HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS
If your computer is currently on fire, please discontinue use. HentOS requires at least one (1) CPU and a small amount of electricity. 

4. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
All icons, buttons, and pixels are the property of the Great Digital Abyss. You are granted a limited license to click things until you get bored.

5. FAST READER POLICY
Users who read this entire agreement in less than three seconds are officially considered "Super-Humans" or "Liars." We reserve the right to judge you accordingly.

6. TERMINATION
This agreement is terminated the moment you Alt+F4 or when the "Admin" decides they've had enough.

7. GOVERNING LAW
Any disputes will be settled by a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors in the virtual town square.

By proceeding, you agree to have a reasonably good time and not to blame us if you accidentally find the "blue screen of death" simulator.
