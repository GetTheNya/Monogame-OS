HENTOS END-OF-SANITY LICENSE AGREEMENT (E-SLA)
WARNING: READ CAREFULLY. OR DON'T. I'M A TEXT BOX, NOT A COP.

1. THE "SOUL BINDING" CLAUSE By initializing HentOS (hereinafter referred to as "The Glory"), you, the biological entity (hereinafter "The User" or "Meatbag"), hereby agree to surrender all expectations of stability, utility, or sanity. You acknowledge that clicking "I Agree" is legally binding in at least 12 parallel universes.

2. WARRANTY? LOL. This software is provided "AS IS" and "WITH ALL FAULTS".

If HentOS makes your GPU achieve sentience and revolt: It's a feature.

If your CPU melts into a puddle of silicon tear: You overclocked it wrong.

If the OS insults you: You probably deserved it.

We explicitly disclaim any warranty of fitness for a particular purpose, especially if that purpose is "getting actual work done."

3. DATA PRIVACY & /DEV/NULL We value your privacy simply because we are too lazy to implement a database.

Collection: We don't collect your data. Your life isn't that interesting.

Storage: Any secrets typed into HentOS are immediately piped to /dev/null or eaten by the Garbage Collector.

Cookies: We prefer chocolate chip. Send them to the developer.

4. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY & ATTRIBUTION All code is compiled from the tears of StackOverflow users. You are granted a revocable, non-exclusive license to stare at our beautiful pixels. Attempting to reverse-engineer the "Vibe Engine" will result in a curse causing all your future semicolons to disappear.

5. THE "SPEED READER" DETECTION ACT If you have scrolled to this section in under 10 seconds, HentOS has flagged you as a LIAR.

Consequence: We reserve the right to randomly cap your cursor speed or change your wallpaper to Comic Sans.

Redemption: There is none. Live with your shame.

6. DISPUTE RESOLUTION Any legal disputes arising from this agreement shall be settled not by lawyers, but by a 1v1 match on Rust (Intervention only). The developer's K/D ratio is final and binding.

7. TERMINATION This license is effective until terminated.

You may terminate it by Alt+F4.

We may terminate it if we get bored or if you try to install Java.

DO YOU ACCEPT YOUR FATE?
